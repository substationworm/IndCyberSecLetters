## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FunkSec

**FunkSec** ([RansomLook](https://www.ransomlook.io/group/funksec), [WatchGuard](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-security-hub/ransomware-tracker/funksec)) is a cyber threat group specializing in ransomware operations and hacktivism that gained prominence in 2024, particularly for its use of artificial intelligence (AI) in malicious activities [(Bitdefender, 2025; SOCRadar, 2025)](#-references). The group has developed an AI-driven malware employing intermittent encryption and code obfuscation techniques [(Alamri & Mooney, 2025)](#-references). **FunkSec** typically combines data exfiltration with encryption in a double-extortion model, exerting pressure on victims to pay the demanded ransom [(Bitdefender, 2025)](#-references).

The group operates a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform, enabling other cybercriminals to leverage its malicious toolset in exchange for payment. As of March 18, 2025, 172 victims have been attributed to **FunkSec**, according to [Ransomware.live](https://www.ransomware.live/group/funksec), spanning multiple sectors and countries. Recent incidents have targeted the communications and water sectors, posing significant risks to critical infrastructure [(Alamri & Mooney, 2025)](#-references).

**FunkSec** also benefits from affiliations with other ransomware groups and online personas, including some linked to [FSociety](https://www.ransomlook.io/group/fsociety) and [Bjorka](https://www.ransomlook.io/group/babuk-bjorka) [(Bitdefender, 2025; SOCRadar, 2025)](#-references).

Figure 01 provides an overview of the **FunkSec** investigation conducted using the [StealthMole](https://www.stealthmole.com)'s platform, with emphasis on the digital footprint of one of the actors involved in the malicious activities: `el_farado`. Key findings regarding this threat actor are outlined in the following section.

- üìù **Notes**.
    - Joined `breachforums.st` in September 2024.
    - Records 1-2-3-4 contain no direct references to **FunkSec**.
    - Starting from record 5, there are explicit mentions of the threat group.
    - Posts, such as in record 6, include forum signatures indicating a connection between the users `el_farado`, `Desertstorm`, and `blako`, with the latter two also linked to **FunkSec** operations.
    - Beginning with record 4, `el_farado` used an avatar depicting Pablo Escobar from the Narcos Netflix series (Figure 02).
    - In record 3, `el_farado` posted: <pre>Hey fellow hackers, I'm curious to know how you handle leaked information like NAME EMAIL ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER. leak databases what it lead</pre> technical reports and investigative analyses have interpreted this as an indication that the persona may be a novice or possess only intermediate knowledge in conducting malicious activities.
    - The Spanish word *hola* appears with relative frequency in forum posts, as well as in a post on X/Twitter and in a Telegram message (`18******89_******`), which will be discussed in greater detail later. As an example, in record 4, `el_farado` stated: <pre>As PoW I will send 'HOLA!' from these address to your given mail address</pre>

### üîç Additional Observations via StealthMole's Platform

- In a `BozKurtlar` thread dated November 12, 2024, at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-BozKurtlar-hacker-*****-*******-****-************`, `el_farado` responded with a lengthy text mimicking a news broadcast, using the expression:<pre>THE HOLA TIMES</pre>
    - In a January 10, 2025, thread at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-I-****-**-****-**-*`, a similar expression was written by `el_farado`:<pre>HOLA TIME's</pre>
- In a thread created by `el_farado`on November 17, 2024, at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-I-****-**-****`, the malicious actor stated:<pre>I wanna learn hacking Website and Databases ( SQL injection, Using CVE to hack ). Like how other guys posting leaks.<br>What should I look for?</pre> This message supports researchers' suspicions that the cybercriminal is still developing technical skills and leveraging pre-built tools and exploits [(Check Point Research, 2025)](#-references).
- Similarly, on September 23, 2024, `el_farado` wrote:<pre>I'm curious to know buying databases from sellers forum.<br>What type of databases are you consider to pay for (email lists, customer data, market research, etc.)?<br>What factors do you consider when evaluating a database for purchase (data accuracy, completeness, relevance, price, etc.)?</pre>
- Also on September 23, 2024, `el_farado` posted:<pre>logging in BF from ClerNet should I??<br>Should I be logging in BF from my real IP. This will give BF my IP could I trust BF to protect that or TRUST NOBODY?</pre>
- The word *hola* and variations of *mamaa* are frequently used. The online persona‚Äôs vocabulary also includes recurrent use of racially derogatory terms, such as *n***** (5-word).
- The post identified on March 24, 2025, at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-S******-Paraguay-*-*******-*******-****` offered for sale Paraguay‚Äôs 2023 voter database, containing approximately 7 million citizen records, including sensitive personal data, addresses, dates of birth, and other information [Schwartz, 2025](#-references). `el_farad` requested payment of USD 10,000 in BTC/XMR and provided contact details via Telegram (`fr_farado`) and qTox (`3D84BC32DF********************************************************306AF53DC4`).
    - `el_farado` also shared samples of this leak via the link `https://gofile.io/*/******` in the X/Twitter post at `https://x.com/EFarado/status/1929***********5905`.
- In a post dated March 28, 2025, at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-Telecommunications-******-Arizona-******-******-**-*******`, `el_farado` offered access to the Supportboard chat system and the corporate email account of a telecommunications company headquartered in Arizona, United States. Contact details were provided via Telegram (`fr_farado`) and qTox (`3D84BC32DF********************************************************306AF53DC4`).
- On November 14, 2024, in response to a thread at `https://breachforums.st/Thread-What-did-you-*****-*****-****-*****`, `el_farado` wrote:<pre>Man I was fighting in war for my country and then somehow I'm on Colombia street selling drugs,<br>and suddenly fallen from a building</pre>
    - Considering the frequent use of the word *hola*; references to Colombia (as in the above message) and Mexico (listed as the location in the user‚Äôs profile, as well as mentioned in the X/Twitter post at `https://x.com/EFarado/status/1936***********7553`); and the entirely Spanish-language biography in the X/Twitter profile [@EFarado](https://x.com/EFarado), there is a working hypothesis that `el_farado` may be a Spanish speaker. However, this hypothesis should be approached with caution, as such indicators could be intentionally fabricated by the cybercriminal.
